# Progress
The following sections will highlight the progress in the domain of Scanning and VR. 
## Scanning
A team visited the Natural History Museum to determine which diorama's to scan next. During this visit the team interacted with the resident Paleontologist and Taxidermist. They provided a background on the climate changes associated with the various diorams's.

## VR
The team created a computuer generation of the caribou's environment. The cropped point cloud caribou was then placed in this environment and the entire scene was experienced in unity vr. 

# Challenges
The size of the point cloud data coupled with the plugin inefficiency causes rendering issues in VR. Dynamic components such as moving grass is also difficult to render. 
# Next Steps

The action items for the next week.
 
- Render the Caribou Diorama in Unreal for VR.

- Insert a fly Asset into the VR scence. This fly has dynamic motion and sound. 

- Create an AR tabletop animal rendering with environment effects.

- Create a forest portal in AR.
