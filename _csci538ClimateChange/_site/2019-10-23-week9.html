<h1 id="progress">Progress</h1>
<p>The following sections will highlight the progress in the domain of Scanning and VR.</p>
<h2 id="scanning">Scanning</h2>
<p>A team visited the Natural History Museum to determine which diorama’s to scan next. During this visit the team interacted with the resident Paleontologist and Taxidermist. They provided a background on the climate changes associated with the various diorams’s.</p>

<h2 id="vr">VR</h2>
<p>The team created a computuer generation of the caribou’s environment. The cropped point cloud caribou was then placed in this environment and the entire scene was experienced in unity vr.</p>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>The size of the point cloud data coupled with the plugin inefficiency causes rendering issues in VR. Dynamic components such as moving grass is also difficult to render.</p>
