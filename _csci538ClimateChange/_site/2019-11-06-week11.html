<h1 id="progress">Progress</h1>
<p>The AR, VR and Scanning components of the project were presented during the midterm presentation. Constructive feedback was providing covering the following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Establish a volume of work with various 3D scans</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Connect to Eric Hanson for advice on data handling, pipelines, workflow to increase point cloud resolution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Establish a list of deliverables</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work on sound</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work on how to show the difference in animal interactions/living conditions when the climate changes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>In order to provide a smooth VR experience the quality of the point cloud rendered in Unreal was compromised. Multiple scans were taken around USC using the AutoDesk ReCap iOS application. Unfortunately, the iOS application has a bug, not allowing us to log into the application despite the correct email and password. To overcome this hiccup, we downloaded the scans from the BLK and exported to desktop using the Leica Application.</p>

<h1 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scanning of the Mountain Goat Exhibit at the NHM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Photogrammetry of the Caribou</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improving resolution of the VR Caribou Point Cloud.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alter the lighting to highlight the natural colors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
